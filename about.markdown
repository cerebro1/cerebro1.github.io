Hi, I am Sonali Srivastava.

It is the need for inner harmony that made me a **wife**, a **mother** and a **family person**.

It is the need for inner harmony that made me apply to **Outreachy May 2022**.

After graduation, i started my journey as system administrator. Exploring and learning Linux
made me realise how much i like Linux based OS and because of that i never used Windows or
MacOS. 

I believe in **balance** and **happiness** in life. Though i was happy, i had no balance. I
used work and work and work and travel (maybe sometime). The desire to have that balance in
life, i met an amazing person who is my husband now and we started a beautiful family. I
very soon understood my priorities and took my career on back seat because it was time for
the new mom to drive. Well the ride has been smooth so far with God's grace. I have been able
to live motherhood to the fullest. I also freelanced as and when possible to keep the balance.

Motherhood should be prioritised and enjoyed. It is something that may not happen again and again.
The feeling to provide training to a new born teaches you to be a better manager. I can for sure say
that my **patience** level has exponentially increased. I learned better ways to communicate because
my trainee understood only the language of love and affection. I could **plan** things better.
I experienced **happiness** in ways i never thought existed.

All this led to **growth** as a person in me. So as James Clear says, "1% Better Every Day",
working in the industry, being a mother and wife completes me as a person who is happy ( may be
sad on some rough days but that will pass ) and all this is possible only because i believe in
**Inner Harmony**
