###TO SUCCEED IN YOUR MISSION, YOU MUST HAVE SINGLE MINDED DEVOTION TO YOUR GOAL
###                                                            - APJ ABDUL KALAM

This does not come easy when one has a struggling career.
To be treated differently at various occasions in life,
I started doubting my capabilities. 

Certain questions that crossed my mind :

- Am I eligible ?

- What if my application gets rejected ? Can I apply again for the next cycle ?

- What if my application is selected but I fail to contribute ?

- How will I ask for help ? Will that imply that I am not capable ?

- And many more.....

**Only way to find out : "Read the Application Guide of Outreachy and Fill the application form"**

## What is Outreachy ?

- Opportunity to know and contribute to FOSS(Free and Open Source Software)

- Chance to comeback after career break

- Not a mandatory requirement to know something in deep in the beginning itself.

- Paid Paid Paid ( Anyone who has watched JabWeMet movie can understand my sentiments here... )

- Vast variety of projects open with all sorts of requirement starting from backend coding, 
testing, documentation, ui/ux dev and many more. 


### How does it work ?

- Round 1 : Application Phase

- Round 2 : Contribution Phase

- Round 3 : Internship Phase


### Application Phase :

The best part of filling the application was going through the [Application Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/) that Outreachy provided.
This is a long guide so dedicate enough time to read the complete document.

# How does this help me ?

- I gained enough confidence to apply.

- Understood the time commitment I was supposed to make.

- Reached out to some [alums](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) via the list provided by Outreachy to gain better understanding.

- Looked back and gave good thoughts at real instances in life which helped me write essays for application.

[Tip that worked for me : Stay honest to yourself and bring the same in application. Things will work out. ]


`Got the much awaited mail in my inbox : "Your Outreachy initial application is approved"`


### Contribution Phase [Roughly 1 month period] :

- Go through project from the [project list](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-may-2022-internship-round/)

- Choose wisely depending upon availability and area of interest.

- Select one or two, go through the requirements. They usually mention the experience level expected.

- In a week, make a call on which one to proceed.

- Contribute as much as possible for higher chances at selection.

- Reach out to mentor for guidance.

- Dedicate 4-5 hours to gain better understanding of project(I had
  to because i was not in touch wit the concepts).

- Confirm from mentor the final project and it's timeline for internship.

- Most important : Make a plan, regular update and track progress.

- The most important : Stick to the plan.

- systemd : Project Selected

`Got the final selection mail and could not be any happier to see my name [here](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2022-05/).`
