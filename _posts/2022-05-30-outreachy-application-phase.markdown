`TO SUCCEED IN YOUR MISSION, YOU MUST HAVE SINGLE MINDED DEVOTION TO YOUR GOAL`
`                                                            - APJ ABDUL KALAM`

This does not come easy when one has a struggling career.
To be treated differently at various occasions in life,
I started doubting my capabilities. 

Certain questions that crossed my mind :

- Am I eligible ?

- What if my application gets rejected ? Can I apply again for the next cycle ?

- What if my application is selected but I fail to contribute ?

- How will I ask for help ? Will that imply that I am not capable ?

- And many more.....

**Only way to find out : "Read the Application Guide and Fill the application form"**

The best part of filling the application was going through the [Application Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/) that Outreachy provided.
This is a long guide so I made sure I was able to dedicate enough time to read the complete document.

How does this help me ?

- I gained enough confidence to apply.

- Understood the time commitment I was supposed to make.

- Reached out to some [alums](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) via the list provided by Outreachy to gain better understanding.

- Looked back and gave good thoughts at real instances in life which helped me write essays for application.

[Tip that worked for me : Stay honest to yourself and bring the same in application. Things will work out. ]


## Got the much awaited mail in my inbox : "Your Outreachy initial application is approved"
